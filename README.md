# Hygieiaâ„  plugin for Jenkins - (started with Slack publisher)

# Developer instructions

Install Maven and JDK.  This was last built with Maven 3.3.9 and JDK 1.8. 

Run unit tests

    mvn test

Create an HPI file to install in Jenkins (HPI file will be in `target/hygieia-publisher.hpi`).

    mvn clean package 

If build fails due to a maven error that looks like this:

`[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project hygieia-publisher: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.jenkins-ci.plugins:hygieia-publisher:hpi:1.3-SNAPSHOT: Could not find artifact com.capitalone.dashboard:core:jar:2.0.2-SNAPSHOT in anonymous (https://mycompany.nexus.com/nexus/content/groups/CLM) -> [Help 1][ERROR]`

Clone Hygieia root, `cd` to `core`, and do `mvn clean install` before building this plugin.


# Important
This plugin uses the Hygieia core package. The main project is JDK 1.8 compiled, if you have Jenkins running on previous Java versions, make sure to recompile core package with that previous version and then build this Jenkins plugin.

#Brief Instruction
