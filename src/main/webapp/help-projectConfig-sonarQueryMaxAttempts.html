    <p>Maximum number of attempts to query SonarQube Compute Engine API to determine analysis results
        SonarQube 5.2+ onwards performs final processing of reports asynchronously and exposes the results through an API
        called Compute Engine. The API needs to be polled to determine completion status. This field stores maximum number
        of attempts to make to the CE API before considering it as a logical time out.
